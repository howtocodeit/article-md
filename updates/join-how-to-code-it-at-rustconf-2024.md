# Join me at RustConf 2024!

::::::standalone{type=update}
I'm incredibly excited to share that I’m speaking at RustConf in Montreal in September! 🦀

My talk will pull back the curtain on Rust in the space industry, sharing insight from my work on Ephemerista, a new, open-source space mission simulator funded by the European Space Agency and maintained by the Libre Space Foundation. 🚀

The title? Well, seeing as you asked...

> "Rust in Space! How Rust is powering next-generation space mission simulators"

Three days in the company of world-renowned Rust experts is my idea of a vacation! There's so much to learn, and I'd love you to join me.

Are you attending RustConf? Lets connect in the comments below. 👋

If you're undecided, here's [the full speaker lineup](https://rustconf.com/speakers). You can [buy tickets here](https://rustconf.com/register/) (you'd be surprised what you can expense at most companies...).

Big thanks to the RustConf team and the Rust Foundation for selecting my talk! I'm looking forward to seeing more speakers announced over the next few weeks.
